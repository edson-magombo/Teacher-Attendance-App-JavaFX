# TEACHER ATTENDANCE APP USING JAVAFX

ignore all the other java files i was using for testing, the main source code for the application is in the source/main.java file. 

Or you can choose to run the compiled jar file in the out/artifacts/JavaFXApp folder.

it was developed three years ago when i started out in JavaFX, even though i've only commited it to github recently. Again, it wasn't done by a pro so there are some bugs, but overall intended functionality runs just fine.

thanks!
