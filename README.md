# TEACHER ATTENDANCE APP USING JAVAFX

ignore the other files, the main source code is in the main.java file. 

Or you can choose to run the compiled jar file in the build/artefacts folder.

it was developed three years ago when i started out in JavaFX, even though i've only commited it to github recently. Again, it wasn't done by a pro so there are some bugs, but overall intended functionality runs just fine.

thanks!
